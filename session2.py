# Review/Refresher

# **Comments**

# Comments help us communicate the purpose of our code. Comments are "hidden" and will not execute or print out to the user when our code runs. Comments can start with a hashtag (#). This is an example of a comment.

# **Print Function**

# The print function will "print" (or show) data to the user.
# The print function is written as print() with the data placed between the parentheses.

print()

# Examples:
print(1)
print(25.51)
print('abc123!@#')
print("hello")

# Strings (str)

# A string is a series of characters, which can include letters, numbers, and special characters.
# 'A string using single quotes (one apostrophe)'
# "A string using double quotes"
# '''A string using triple single quotes (three apostrophes)'''

# Write a function that prints "Hello world!" to the user.
print('Hello world!')

# **Variables**

# Variables are pieces of memory that store our data.
# When code runs into a variable, Python retrieves the value assigned to the variable for the function (or task) being executed. We create a variable by using an equal sign (=) to assign a value.

# w = 290,000
# women = 290,000
# women_who_code = 290,000

coding = "Yay!"
print(coding)

# **Integer (int)**

# Integers are whole numbers, no decimal points. Can be positive or negative.
# Examples: 3, 27, 28384723, -10, -234
awesome_integer = -300
print(awesome_integer)

# **Floating Point Numbers (float)**

# Floating point numbers, or floats, are numbers with decimal points. Can be positive or negative.Examples: 3.1415926, 1.0, 100.5, -5.5, -233.33
awesome_float = 3.14
print(awesome_float)
