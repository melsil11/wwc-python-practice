# STRINGS

# A string is a series of characters, which can include letters, numbers, and special characters such as exclamation points.

# We can use the following formats to print a string: 1) single quotes (one apostrophe), 2) double quotes, or 3) triple single quotes (three apostrophes).

# print('single quotes') 

# print("double quotes") 

# print('''triple single quotes''')

# when we run the following code, all print functions will print the same result "Hello World"

print('Hello world!') 
print("Hello world!") 
print('''Hello world!''')

# Here is an example of when triple single quotes (three apostrophes) could be useful.
# The quote includes a quotation in double quotes and an apostrophe for the word "You're".
print('''Stephanie says, "You're amazing!"''')

# Or we can use a backwards slash to escape an apostrophe (or double quotes).
# This example uses apostrophes around the string and a backslash before the apostrophe in "You're."
print('Stephanie says, "You\'re amazing!"')

# Multiply a string by a number (integer).
print('Hello' * 3)

# Here is an example of when triple single quotes (three apostrophes) could be useful.
# The quote includes a quotation in double quotes and an apostrophe for the word "You're".
print('''Stephanie says, "You're amazing!"''')

# Or we can use a backwards slash to escape an apostrophe (or double quotes).
# This example uses apostrophes around the string and a backslash before the apostrophe in "You're."
print('Stephanie says, "You\'re amazing!"')
# Practice
print('Tell it to me stright')
# Practice:
print(' mel says "you\'re Amazing"')
# Multiply a string by a number (integer).
print('Hello' * 3)
# HelloHelloHello
# Practice:
print('Hi' * 2)
# HiHi
# to print with spaces add a space after the word but before the closing quote
print('hello ' * 3)

# Check the character length of a string using the len() function.
print(len('Hello!'))
# Practice:
print(len('Melanie Silva'))
# it counts spaces as characters

# We can also add together, or concatenate, more than one string.
# We will be using concatenation often in future sessions.
print("Hi, " + "Stephanie" + "!") 

# Note the space after "Hi, " in this example and how the code executes.

# practice:
print('Hi, ' + 'Melanie' +'!' )
