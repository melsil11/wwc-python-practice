# STRINGS

# A string is a series of characters, which can include letters, numbers, and special characters such as exclamation points.

# We can use the following formats to print a string: 1) single quotes (one apostrophe), 2) double quotes, or 3) triple single quotes (three apostrophes).

# print('single quotes') 

# print("double quotes") 

# print('''triple single quotes''')

# when we run the following code, all print functions will print the same result "Hello World"

print('Hello world!') 
print("Hello world!") 
print('''Hello world!''')

# Here is an example of when triple single quotes (three apostrophes) could be useful.
# The quote includes a quotation in double quotes and an apostrophe for the word "You're".
print('''Stephanie says, "You're amazing!"''')

# Or we can use a backwards slash to escape an apostrophe (or double quotes).
# This example uses apostrophes around the string and a backslash before the apostrophe in "You're."
print('Stephanie says, "You\'re amazing!"')

# Multiply a string by a number (integer).
print('Hello' * 3)
